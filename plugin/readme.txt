== Description ==

= Great marketers know = 
Today’s leaders know that digital is a critical component for how they win the hearts and minds of customers. Research finds that upwards of 70% of buying decisions takes place before a person even talks to the sales organization – and much of that purchase decision is driven by what the buyer finds on the web. This makes digital channels, and most importantly your website, the most authoritative source for your buyers.
