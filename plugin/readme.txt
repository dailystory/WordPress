## What is Customer Engagement

Customer engagement is a connection between a customer and a company or brand. This connection can be a reaction, interaction, effect or overall customer experience.

Successful customer engagement builds and grows your customer relationships and opportunities. It creates brand loyalty and positive views of the business. And, it increases average customer spend with the business.

And we're experts at customer engagement. 

Our team has helped some of the world's best brands create more meaningful connections with their customers.

## The DailyStory Customer Engagement Platform
DailyStory includes landing pages, link tracking, web forms, exit intent, welcome mats, email autoresponder and more. You can use these tools to create more opportunities to convert visitors. 

For example, you can embed a newsletter sign up form on any WordPress page or post with a simple shortcode.

And, once DailyStory is managing the converted visitor, use campaigns, automation, rules, scoring, and workflow to automate common actions.
